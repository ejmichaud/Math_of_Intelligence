# Math_of_Intelligence

This is a submission for the challenge from [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRJCOz3AfYY) video by [Siraj Raval](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWN3xxRkmTPmbKwht9FuE5A).

# Overview
This code helps to answer an essential question:
> **_What do people look for in a date_**?

To investigate, I used [this](https://www.kaggle.com/annavictoria/speed-dating-experiment) Kaggle dataset:
>Data was gathered from participants in experimental speed dating events from 2002-2004. During the events, the attendees would have a four minute "first date" with every other participant of the opposite sex. At the end of their four minutes, participants were asked if they would like to see their date again. They were also asked to rate their date on six attributes: Attractiveness, Sincerity, Intelligence, Fun, Ambition, and Shared Interests.

My code determines if there is a positive correlation between a dateâ€™s perceived intelligence and their _match_ success rate by carrying out a **Linear Regression** using **Gradient Descent**.
